# cmiv-cli

A command line interface which auto generates a frontend framework

**UPDATE: (now written in Rust, final binary size reduced and runtime speed increased)**

Pick from these options (so far):

- NextJS App Router
- BlitzJS App Router
- RedwoodJS (Typescript)
- AstroJS
- Preact Vite Typescript
- SolidJS Vite Typescript
- Svelte Vite Typescript

## Installation

---
Pick one of the binaries from the GitHub releases and add it to your PATH

You can also build `CMIV-CLI` yourself, provided that Rust is installed via `cargo build --release`
